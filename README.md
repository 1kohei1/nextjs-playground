# SD scheduler

UCF senior design has to schedule the final presentation. There is no easy way to coordinate the schedule. This project is to provides easy way for both faculties and students to handle senior design final presentation scheduling.

## Problems

Students:
* Don't know who will be available at what time
* Don't know what time other groups are requesting

Faculties:
* Too cumbersome to tell if he/she is available on requested time
* Has to handle scheduling by themselves
