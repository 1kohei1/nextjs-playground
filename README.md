# SD scheduler

UCF senior design final presentation must coordinate presentation time. There is no easy way to coordinate the schedule. This software provides easy way for both faculties and students to handle senior design final presentation scheduling.

## Problems

Students:
* Don't know who will be available at what time
* Don't know what time other groups are requesting

Faculties:
* Too cumbersome to tell if he/she is available on requested time
* Has to mark them on the calendar
